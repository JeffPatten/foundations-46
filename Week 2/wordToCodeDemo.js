// Write a function called damageAndDebuff that
// can take in `healthTotal`,`baseDamage`,
// and `healthDebuff` arguments.

// Inside the function, subtract
// the value of the base damage from the health total, 
// and update the total to that value. 
// Calculate the healthDebuff and 
// subtract it from the total. 
// Return the new healthTotal.  

// Note: the numbers passed in for `healthDebuff` will be
// decimals, for example: .15 for a 15% health debuff.
